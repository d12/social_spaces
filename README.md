# Social Spaces

## Mission

Lower the barriers for employees trying to remotely socialize, bond with, and meet new people within their company.

## What are those barriers?

- Don’t know what sort of social activities are possible in a remote world
- Don’t know who is interested in participating
- Difficult to find overlapping time between lots of people
- Difficult to coordinate social activities remotely with large numbers of people
- Difficult to setup and facilitate remote social activities

## The solution

A "hub" where people within a company can partake in various social activities.

- Setup public/private games
- Auto-join existing game (matchmaking)

Games have a hangouts call already setup.

For third party games, we can try to set it up if there's an API. If not, we can embed. If we can't do that, we can give instructions.

"Games" don't have to be video games at all. It could be social games (The interface could facilitate the game, tell people their roles, etc), or even just casual hangouts.

The "AoR" is all things empowering social connectivity within a company, so I think the functionality here can be expanded quite a bit.

## Audience

Remote or partially remote companies.

Each enterprise will have their own insulated space. Employees will only interact with employees at the same company.

## Does something like this exist?

Not that I could find.
