# Social Spaces

## Problem Statement

Buiding relationships and making strong connections has always been a struggle as a remote employee. With the vast majority of companies forced to be remote at the moment (and many committing to be remote-first forever), this struggle has been realized by a lot of people.

## Mission

Lower the barriers for employees trying to remotely socialize, bond with, and meet new people within their company.

## What are those barriers?

- Don’t know what sort of social activities are possible in a remote world
- Don’t know who is interested in participating
- Difficult to find overlapping time between lots of people
- Difficult to coordinate social activities remotely with large numbers of people
- Difficult to setup and facilitate remote social activities

## The solution

A "hub" where people within a company can partake in various social activities.

Activities have a hangouts / Zoom call already setup.

For third party games, we can try to set it up if there's an API. If not, we can embed. If we can't do that, we can give instructions for how to play and setup the hangouts/zoom

Activities don't have to be video games. It could be social games (The interface could facilitate the game, tell people their roles, etc), or even just casual hangouts.

The "AoR" is all things empowering social connectivity within a company, so I think the functionality here can be expanded quite a bit.

## Audience

Remote or partially remote companies.

Each enterprise will have their own insulated space. Employees will only interact with employees at the same company.

## Does something like this exist?

Not that I could find.

## What's up with the name?

It's temporary.
